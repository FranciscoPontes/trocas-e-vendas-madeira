<h3>Trocas e Vendas App</h3>

This project was born from a master's course assignment. It allows the user to publish and read publications regarding items to sell or trade.
I took the chance to pratice my React skills, and experienced other software like Algolia. Furthermore, I used Firebase, as often, to quickly set up the database and authentication.

Recently, I upgraded the project to a PWA, which means you can use it on your desktop or android!
